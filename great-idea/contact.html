                <p>One of the symptoms of an absence of innovation is the fact that you lose your jobs. Everyone else catches up with you. They can do what you do better than you or cheaper than you. And in a multinational corporate-free market enterprise,
                    it is the company's obligation to take the factory to a place where they can make it more cheaply.</p>
